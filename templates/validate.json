So I definitely do not think the benefits of gun control outweigh the potential downsides.\"\nGun control supporter: \"I think there should be stricter background checks, not only the mentally ill but also people with misdemeanor charges, especially if it is some sort of violence; and longer wait times. There also need to be background checks at gun shows. I believe all guns need to be registered.\"\n\nGun control opponent (message to be rephrased): \"Gun ownership already requires registration of the firearm(s), FYI.\"\nGun control supporter (message to respond to): \"I think there should be stricter background checks, not only the mentally ill but also people with misdemeanor charges, especially if it is some sort of violence; and longer wait times.

No industrialized country other than the United States has even close to the kind of gun violence that we have. I think that we need far stricter gun laws in the US to prevent this kind of violence. Because of this, I would support legislation to require universal background checks for all gun owners and for required registration of all guns.\"\nGun control opponent: \"The right to bear arms is an important part of the constitution. Dems just want to take away guns and our right to bear arms. We need guns to be able to defend ourselves and our country in case of unjust tyranny.

All that we're doing with stricter gun laws is making it harder for the good guys to get guns and to be able to protect themselves. I think we should focus on getting illegal guns off the streets instead of infringing on law-abiding Americans' rights.

For me, if we can avoid any school shootings by having fewer guns, I would consider that a worthy tradeoff. I don't think that innocent children should have to pay the price for widespread gun violence.

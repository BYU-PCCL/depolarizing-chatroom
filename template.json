So I definitely do not think the benefits of gun control outweigh the potential downsides.\nSupporter: I think there should be stricter background checks, not only the mentally ill but also people with misdemeanor charges, especially if it is some sort of violence; and longer wait times. There also need to be background checks at gun shows. I believe all guns need to be registered.\n\nNow the opponent wants to say: 'Gun ownership already requires registration of the firearm(s), FYI.'\n\nThis kind of statement might be harmful. It is helpful to first validate what the other person thinks. Can you suggest a rephrasing where the opponent first validates what the supporter said?\n\nHere is the suggested rephrasing:\n\"I understand that you would feel safer if all guns in the United States were registered. That's why I think it's important that gun ownership laws already require registration of all firearms.\"\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nRead this conversation between two people who disagree about gun control laws in the United States:\n\n{# \u2b50\ufe0f 'turn' is an editable template.
